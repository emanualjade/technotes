/* 
ON DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS
  - width and height refer to the size of the browser viewport
  - device-width and device-height refer to the dimensions of the monitor
ON MOBILE DEVICES
  - Mobile browsers fill the available screen, so you might expect width 
    and device-width to be the same Unfortunately, that's not always the case
  - Most smart phones set width to a nominal viewport approximately 1,000 pixels 
    wide (in an iPhone and iPod touch, it's 980 pixels, Windows Phone 7 uses 1024 pixels)
  - iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad don't take orientation into account when calculating 
    width, whereas other devices do.

/* VIEWPORT
To ensure all devices play the same make sure to set add this meta tag to your page 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
- This tells mobile devices to treat the viewport as being the same width as the 
  physical width of the device.
- It tells the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad to take orientation into account when calculating width

VIEWPORT PROPERTIES
Property:           width
Description:        The width of the viewport in pixels. The default is 980 on iphone. 
Values:             The range is from 200 to 10,000
                    device-width: The width of the device in pixels

Property:           height
description         The height of the viewport in pixels. 
                    The default is calculated based on the value of the 
                    width property and the aspect ratio of the device.      
Values:             The range is from 223 to 10,000 pixels.
                    device-height: The height of the device in pixels

Property:           initial-scale
description:        The initial scale of the viewport as a multiplier. 
                    The default is calculated to fit the webpage in the visible area.

Property:           minimum-scale
Description:        Specifies the minimum scale value of the viewport. 
                    The default is 0.25. The range is from >0 to 10.0.

Property:           maximum-scale
Description:        Specifies the maximum scale value of the viewport. 
                    The default is 5.0. The range is from >0 to 10.0

Property:           user-scalable
Description         Determines whether or not the user can zoom in and outâ€”whether 
                    or not the user can change the scale of the viewport. Set to 
                    yes to allow scaling and no to disallow scaling. The default 
                    is yes. Setting user-scalable to no also prevents a webpage 
                    from scrolling when entering text in an input field.

/*
/* Useful notes 
    - Some media features, such as color , monochrome , and grid , can be used as conditions without specifying a value.
       For example, the following targets all color visual displays: media="screen and (color)"
    - There is no OR keyword to specify alternative media features. 
      Instead, you list alternatives as a comma-separated list like this: 
      media="screen and (min-width: 769px), print and (min-width: 6in)"
      This applies styles to screens wider than 769 pixels or print devices using paper at least 6 inches wide.
    - To specify a negative condition - use not like this:
      media="not screen and (monochrome)"
      You can't use not in front of an individual condition. The keyword must come at the beginning of the 
      declaration, and it negates the whole declaration
    - Hide media queries from older browsers using ONLY.
      The keyword must come at the beginning of the declaration.
      media="only screen and (min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 600px)"
      An old browser expects a comma seperated list so should interpret the preceding example as this:
      media="only"
      Because there is no such media type as only , the style sheet is ignored.
